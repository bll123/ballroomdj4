BallroomDJ 4 is currently under development.

Alpha Release: 202209??

  Alpha releases are mostly untested works in progress.

  Alpha releases may not reflect what the final product will look like,
  and may not reflect what features will be present in the final product.

Installation:
  Windows:
    a) Run the BallroomDJ 4 installer.

  Linux:
    a) Download the linux-pre-install.sh script from:
        https://sourceforge.net/projects/ballroomdj4/files/linux-pre-install.sh/download
      and run it.
      This script uses sudo to install the required packages.
    b) Run the BallroomDJ 4 installer.

  MacOS:
    The BallroomDJ 4 installer will not work on MacOS without step (a).

    a) Download the macos-pre-install-macports.sh script from:
        https://sourceforge.net/projects/ballroomdj4/files/macos-pre-install-macports.sh/download
      and run it.
      This script uses sudo to install the required packages (from MacPorts).
      [ I have not tested with 'brew'.  That's in the future someday. ]
    b) Run the BallroomDJ 4 installer.

Converting BallroomDJ 3:
  If you have a recent version of BallroomDJ 3, and the installer is
  able to locate your installation, the BallroomDJ 3 data files will
  automatically be converted during the installation process.
  The BallroomDJ 3 installation is not changed and may still be used.

  If you have an older version of BallroomDJ 3, and the installer says
  that your "BDJ3 database version is too old", use the following
  process.  This process is set up to preserve your original BallroomDJ
  installation and make sure it is not changed.
    - Copy your entire BallroomDJ 3 folder to another location and/or name.
      (e.g. BallroomDJ to BDJ3Temp)
    - Rename the BallroomDJ shortcut on the desktop to a new name
      (e.g. "BallroomDJ original").
    - Download the latest version of BallroomDJ 3.
    - Run the installer, but choose the new location as the installation
      location.  The BallroomDJ 3 installation process will upgrade your
      database and data files to the latest version.
    - Delete the BallroomDJ shortcut on the desktop (it is pointing to
      the new location).
    - Rename the original BallroomDJ shortcut back the way it was
      (e.g. "BallroomDJ original" to BallroomDJ).
    - Now run the BDJ4 installation process again.  For the BallroomDJ 3
      location, choose the new location for BallroomDJ 3.
    - Remove the new location of BallroomDJ 3 (e.g. BDJ3Temp).  Your
      original BallroomDJ installation is untouched and can still be used.

Known Issues:
  All Platforms
    - The song selection display may display strange values for numeric
      columns (will be fixed at a later date).
  Windows
    - The marquee position is not saved when it is iconified (close the
      window instead).
