BDJ4 4.0.0

BallroomDJ 4 is currently under development.

Alpha Release: 20220312

This release represents a working player user interface.
It should be usable with a BallroomDJ 3 installation.

The song selection filter dialog will change in the future.
Several of the currently displayed selections will be hidden by default.

Alpha releases are mostly untested works in progress.

This alpha release will not work without a BallroomDJ 3 installation.

It contains only the player interface.
No music or playlist management is present.
No configuration is present.

Alpha releases may not reflect what the final product will look like,
and may not reflect what features will be present in the final product.

Anything can and will change.

There are no instructions yet.  If you want to try this, ask on the
forum for help.
