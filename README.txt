and may not reflect what features will be present in the final product.

Anything can and will change.

There are no instructions yet.  If you want to try this, ask on the
forum for help.

This release represents a working player user interface.
It should be usable with a BallroomDJ 3 installation.

This release contains the player user interface and configuration interface.
